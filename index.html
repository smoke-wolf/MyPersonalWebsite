<p>I am Maliq Barnard</p>
<p>My proficiency spans across Python, Bash, Shell, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I have dabbled in Java, Ruby, and C++. Additionally, I'm well-acquainted with popular frameworks like React and Node.js, along with the versatile Python Imaging Library (PIL). As a developer, I'm dedicated to expanding my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects, and if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch</p>
              <br><br><br>
              <p>I've been passionately working on the GitHub Package Manager project for nearly a year now. This ambitious project, known as GHPM, comprises an extensive codebase, with 6335 lines of Python code, as well as a significant amount of additional code and resources that aren't directly within the app itself. One of my primary objectives has been to enhance the user interface, revamp historic and legacy versions and methods, and deliver an improved user experience. It's worth noting that these enhancements are exclusively accessible to users who download the application through the ghpm page rather than through GitHub.</p>
